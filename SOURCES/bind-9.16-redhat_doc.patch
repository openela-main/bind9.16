+**Red Hat SELinux BIND Security Profile:**
+
+By default, Red Hat ships BIND with the most secure SELinux policy
+that will not prevent normal BIND operation and will prevent exploitation
+of all known BIND security vulnerabilities. See the selinux(8) man page
+for information about SElinux.
+
+It is not necessary to run named in a chroot environment if the Red Hat
+SELinux policy for named is enabled. When enabled, this policy is far
+more secure than a chroot environment. Users are recommended to enable
+SELinux and remove the bind-chroot package.
+
+*With this extra security comes some restrictions:*
+
+By default, the SELinux policy does not allow named to write outside directory
+/var/named. That directory used to be read-only for named, but write access is
+enabled by default now.
+
+The "named" group must be granted read privelege to
+these files in order for named to be enabled to read them.
+Any file updated by named must be writeable by named user or named group.
+
+Any file created in the zone database file directory is automatically assigned
+the SELinux file context *named_zone_t* .
+
+The Red Hat BIND distribution and SELinux policy creates three directories where
+named were allowed to create and modify files: */var/named/slaves*, */var/named/dynamic*
+*/var/named/data*. The service is able to write and file under */var/named* with appropriate
+permissions. They are used for better organisation of zones and backward compatibility.
+Files in these directories are automatically assigned the '*named_cache_t*'
+file context, which SELinux always allows named to write.
